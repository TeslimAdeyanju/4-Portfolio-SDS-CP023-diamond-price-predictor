1. Identify correlation between feature and target variable.
2. if there is no correlation we may drop those features. Note that this is not only applicable for linear regression,\ 
    it is also applicable for other machine learning models as well.
3. Multi collinearity means High correlation among the independent variables. It can cause issues with linear & logistic regression models, \
   whereas tree based models & gradient boosting are less sensitive to Multi collinearity.
4. You can either remove one/some of correlated features or you can combine them using PCA.
